                                the world has ever seen. The society consisted of four Сourts: 
                                the Hearts, the Diamonds, the Spades, and the Clubs - each 
                                representing a different strength: beauty, wisdom, courage, 
                                and intellect. Within each of these Сourts lived the writers, 
                                artists, musicians, healers, engineers, and leaders of the world.

                                jealousy grew as none of the Сourts accepted him. One night, as 
                                the courts danced together in one of their frequent magical parties, 
                                the <span class="b">J</span>oker poisoned the flowing champagne with a special tongue curse. 
                                From that day forward, each time the members tried to speak about their 
                                beloved Сourts and society, they couldn't find the words. They were tongue tied.

                            She knew she had to reverse the Joker's curse and reignite this glorious society, 
                            so she created the deck of cards, with each Сourt's symbol hand painted as a calling to 
                            anyone else in the world who may remember. After years of relentless work, her cards fell 
                            into the hands of a long lost King, who had been hopeless, believing the society was gone 
                            forever. He found his <span class="red b">Q</span>ueen of Hearts and together they created a magical deck of cards that 
                            reversed the curse. These cards await you, so draw one for reintroduction into your Сourt.

                    <p>
                        <span>A</span>lexandra Houx Grounds is a young, female, American oil painter specializing in  large scale
                        portraiture. Her hyper-realistic technique merges with her surrealist style to create one of a kind paintings 
                        that often depict classic iconic females and peers, also closer examinations of the human body. 
                        Grounds is a pioneer in female self-representation, and has forged her own path in the art world. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Her bold, vibrant work and direct-to-collector approach have landed her paintings in the most prestigious private 
                        art collections in the world. She has long believed that blockchain technology is the future of art, revolutionizing 
                        how people interact, collect, sell, and learn about artists and their work. Grounds currently has work displayed at 
                        the World Trade Center as well as the museum at Castello di Ugento in Puglia, Italy.

                            1. Create a Phantom Wallet
                            <br>
                            If you are creating a Phantom wallet for the first time, make sure you write down or store your 12-word seed phrase somewhere safe in case you need to restore your wallet in the future!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            2. Purchase some SOL
                            <br>
                            We recommend purchasing SOL on Coinbase, FTX, or Binance depending on your location!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            3. Transfer SOL to your Phantom Wallet
                            <br>
                            You can copy your Phantom wallet address simply by clicking on the name of your wallet at the top of the Phantom plug-in window. Send SOL to this address.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            4. Connect your Phantom wallet by clicking "Connect" on TongueTiedSociety.com
                            <br>
                            Before connecting, ensure the web address is correct. This is our only official website. Stay vigilant to avoid scams!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            5. Click MINT and approve the transaction in your Phantom pop-up
                            <br>
